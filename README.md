# Bare-Metal UART Debug Console

This is a bare-metal interrupt-driven UART Debug Console written in C includes Button-LED logic, UART-based control of the on-board LED echoing strings from the host PC terminal, and supports debug messages from the firmware to a host PC terminal using programs such as PuTTY or minicom. The debug console uses direct register access and is written for the STM Nucleo-F411RE Development Board and a virtualized version of that board in Renode.

## Installation

To run this repository locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository 
using HTTPS:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/tmooney84/Bare-Metal-STM32-UART-Debug-Console.git
    ```

using SSH:
    ```sh
    git clone git@github.com:tmooney84/Bare-Metal-STM32-UART-Debug-Console.git 
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd /Bare-Metal-STM32-UART-Debug-Console
    ```

## Usage

### 1. If running on a physical STM Nucleo-F411RE Board 

A. open the STM32CubeIDE and connect the board using the microUSB cable. If you need to install STM32CubeIDE visit     https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html.
    
B. Once you have opened the IDE, make sure you are in the correct workspace and navigate to the Bare-Metal-STM32-UART-Debug-Console project. The main project code can be found in the Src and Inc sub-directories.

C. Next build the project and download the firmware to the STM board. Look to IDE Help guide for further details.
    
D. Once the firmware is loaded on the board, the on-board PC-13 button should toggle the PA-5 LED on and off. 

### 2. If emulating the the board using Renode 
  A. Open Renode and start the Renode Script (.resc) for the virtual board and firmware.
  
  ```renode
  start @/absolute-path-to-repository-folder/renode-emulation/UART_debug_console.resc
  ```

  B. To simulate Pressing and Releasing the button type Press and Release commands in succession and then check the virtual LED's state.
  
  ```renode
  (nucleo_f411re) gpioc.buttonPC13 Press
  ```
 
  ```renode
  (nucleo_f411re) gpioc.buttonPC13 Release
  ```
  
  ```renode
  (nucleo_f411re) gpioa.greenled2 State
  ```

  C. To simulate typing into a host computer terminal editor, type commands such as "led on", "led off", "led toggle", "echo \"string\" "ctrl + H" and "sysinfo" into the Terminal Analyzer window.

  1) Turning LED on

  ```terminal analyzer
  input: led on
  output: LED ON
  ```

  ```renode
  (nucleo_f411re) gpioa.greenled2 State
  ```

  2) Turning LED off
  ```terminal analyzer
  input: led off
  output: LED OFF
  ```

  ```renode
  (nucleo_f411re) gpioa.greenled2 State
  ```

  3) Toggling LED
  ```terminal analyzer
  input: led toggle
  output: ["LED ON" or "LED OFF"]
  ```
  ```renode
  (nucleo_f411re) gpioa.greenled2 State
  ```


  4) Echoing String
  ```terminal analyzer
  input: echo "Hello World!"
  output: Hello World!
  ```

  5) Ctrl + H for HELP MENU
  ```terminal analyzer
  input: ctrl + H
  output: HELP MENU
	   echo \"<message>\": This display a message back on host machine.
	   led on: This command will turn the led on.
     led off: This will turn the led off.
	   led toggle: This will toggle the led switch on/off.
     sysinfo: This will display vital system information including board name, processor speed, baud rate, memory size
  ```

  6) sysinfo for SYSTEM INFORMATION
  ```terminal analyzer
  input: sysinfo
  output: processor speed: $ps
		   flash size: $fsKB
		   "SRAM size: 128KB
		   "baud rate: $br
  ```
  

### 3. If running the Automated Testing using Robot Framework
A. Navigate to the renode-emulation subdirectory
    ```bash
    cd renode-emulation
    ```
B. Run run_tests.py script
  ```powershell
  python run_tests.py  (Windows)
  ```
  
  ```bash
  python3 run_tests.py (Linux)
  ```
